# Character Creation

Each player starts by creating 3-4 Hero characters.  
If 3 players are playing, they make 4 Heroes each.  
If 4 or more players are playing, they make 3 Heroes each.

Create each Hero by deciding on:

- A name
- A 1-sentence background
- 2 Traits
- 1 Tool or 1 Talent

### Traits

A Trait is a word that describes the character.  
When you play the character, use their Traits to decide on how they act.

Example traits:

- Tall and Strong
- Small and Quiet
- Dumb but Fast
- Sickly and Pale

### Tools

A Tool is a special Item that can be used several times.  
Only the Tool's owner can use it as a Tool, otherwise it is an Item.  
After a Challenge using a Tool lands on a 1, then the Tool stops working, as a regular item would.

When using a Tool for a regular challenge, the highest Difficulty rating it can be is 4.  
You can try outrageous challenges with your Tool, and still use that rating of 4.  
This ability does not apply for rolling to **Kill** or to **Survive**.

Example tools:

- A garden rake
- A long spear
- A stylish suit
- A lunchbox

### Talents

A Talent is a custom Challenge that the character can use.  
Challenges using Talents always have a Difficulty rating of 3.  
Choose what the challenge is, and the Outcome.  
The Danger level is set in the moment, depending on circumstance.

You cannot roll to **Kill** or to **Survive** using a Talent.

Example talents:

- Charm someone: Friendly Outcome
- Pick a lock: Helpful Outcome
- Climb a Wall: Sneaky Outcome
- Burn something: Destructive Outcome

### Life

Each Hero has 2 Life.  
When a Hero has no Life left, they die.
