# Character Creation

Each player starts by creating 3-4 Hero characters.  
If 3 players are playing, they make 4 Heroes each.  
If 4 or more players are playing, they make 3 Heroes each.

Create each Hero by deciding on:

- A name
- A 1-sentence background
- 2 Traits
- 1 Tool or 1 Talent

### Traits

A Trait is a word that describes the character.  
When you play the character, use their Traits to decide on how they act.  
For example:

- Tall and Strong
- Small and Quiet
- Dumb but Fast
- Sickly and Pale

### Tools

A Tool is a special Item that can be used several times.  
Only the Tool's owner can use it as a Tool, otherwise it is an Item.  
After a Challenge using a Tool lands on a 1, then the Tool stops working, as a regular item would.  
For example:

- A garden rake
- A long spear
- A stylish suit
- A lunchbox

### Talents

A Talent is a custom Challenge that the character can use.  
Challenges using Talents always have a Difficulty rating of 3.  
Choose what the challenge is, and the Outcome.  
The Danger level is set in the moment, depending on circumstance.  
You cannot roll **Kill** or **Survive** using a Talent.  
For example:

- Charm someone: Friendly Outcome
- Pick a lock: Helpful Outcome
- Climb a Wall: Sneaky Outcome

Each Hero has 2 Life.  
When a Hero has no Life left, they die.
