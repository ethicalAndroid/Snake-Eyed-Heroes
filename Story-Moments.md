# Story

In this game, every story has 3 acts.  
Each act has a theme, with the third act ending the game.  
After the end of act 1 and act 2, if a player has 0 characters left, another player can lend them 1 of their own characters.

After the final act, the surviving characters level up and become real heroes!  
They survived, and that should be celebrated!  
You can bring these Heroes into other games, as 1st Level characters.

## Leveling Up

In Snake-Eyed Heroes, returning characters regain their lost Life and their Tools are back to normal.  
For each Level up, characters gain +1 Life total.  
They also gain either 1 new Tool, or 1 new Talent.

Characters can Level up to 3rd Level.

## Heroic Death

When a Death happens, then a character can try to be a Hero.  
When a character tries to be a Hero, then their next Challenge has its Difficulty rating set to 3.  
This heroism even applies rolling to **Kill**.

## Villainous Death

When the final Villain is killed, the tension ramps up.  
Many characters will be instantly put in a Bad situation.  
The specific characters that are affected by a Villanous Death will depend on the villain's allies and the nearby dangers.
