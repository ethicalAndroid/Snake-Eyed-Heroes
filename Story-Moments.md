# What is Snake-Eyed Heroes?

This game is about 0th Level characters, trying to be heroes!  
Or at least die trying.  
It is a very loose game that deals with Challenges and Outcomes.

## Story

The story has 3 acts.  
Each act has a theme, with the third act ending the game.  
After the end of act 1 and act 2, if a player has 0 characters left, another player can lend them 1 of their own characters.

After the final act, the surviving characters level up and become real heroes!  
They survived, and that should be celebrated!  
You can bring these Heroes into other games, as 1st Level characters.

## Leveling Up

In Snake-Eyed Heroes, returning characters regain their lost Life, and any Tools.  
For each Level up, characters gain +1 Life total.  
They also gain either 1 new Tool, or 1 new Talent.

Characters can Level up to 2nd Level.

## Heroic Death

When a Death happens, then a character can try to be a Hero.  
When a character tries to be a Hero, then the next challenge they roll has its rating set to 3.  
This includes rolling to **Kill**.

## Villainous Death

When the final Villain is killed, the tension ramps up.  
Many characters will be put in a Bad situation.  
The specific characters that are affected by a Villanous Death will depend on the villain's allies and the nearby dangers.
