# Combat

Combat begins whenever villains start to attack the heroes.  
When the attacking stops, the combat stops as well.

## Player Actions

Each player has a turn to act.  
Use your turn and choose one:

- Explain what your characters do.
- Use 1 character to Act with a Challenge, to try to get an Outcome.

After each turn, the Game Master explains the outcome, if a character Acts.

Each player can only take 1 turn per round.  
At the end of the round, the Game Master must choose 2 different Villain Actions, and then a new round begins.

## Villain Actions

Villain Actions are used to show what happens when a bad situation is not resolved or to show how the villains in the story act.  
You cannot choose the same Villain Action multiple times in the same round.

Choose two:

- Force all characters that are in Bad situations to roll to **Survive** twice.
- Move some villains towards the heroes.
- Cut to a villain that is currently off-screen.
- Force 1-3 characters into a Bad situation, for next round.

**Survive Challenge**: Dangerous | Rating 5 | Escape Outcome

## Bad and Worse Situations

If you are in a Bad situation and you get a Bad-situation outcome again, then you are now in a Worse situation.  
A Worse situation is technically still a Bad situation, it's just worse.  
When rolling to Survive when in a **Worse** situation, you must **roll 3 times**.  
For each additional Bad situation, then you add +1 to the Worse.  
When rolling to Survive when in a **Worse + X** situation, you must **roll 3+X times**.

When you roll to Survive, you escape the situation if you succeed even once.  
If a non-Escape outcome helps you when in a Worse situation, you are now in a Bad situation.  
If a non-Escape outcome helps you when in a Bad situation, you are no longer in a Bad situation.  
When a danger is resolved, then all Bad and Worse situations from that danger end.

## Villain Enemies

Just like heroes, enemies have Life.  
Enemies die once they have no Life left.  
The amount of Life that each enemy has is related to its type.

- Minions and tiny enemies have 1 Life.
- Smart or strong enemies have 2 Life.
- Brutes and specialists have 3 Life.
- The Final Villain has 4 Life.
