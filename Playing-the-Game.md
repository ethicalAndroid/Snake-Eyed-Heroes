# Acting

Each player has a turn to act.  
Use your turn and choose one:

- Explain what their characters do.
- Use 1 character to Act with a Challenge, to try to get an Outcome.

After each turn, the Game Master explains the outcome, if a character Acts.

Each player can only take 1 turn per round.  
At the end of the round, the Game Master must choose 2 different Villain Actions, and then a new round begins.

## Villain Actions

Villain Actions are used to show what happens when a bad situation is not resolved, or to show how the villains in the story act.  
You cannot choose the same Villain Action multiple times in the same round.

Choose two:

- Force all character that are in Bad situations to roll **Survive** twice.
- Move some villains towards the heroes.
- Cut to a villain that is currently off screen.
- Force a character into a Bad situation.

**Survive Challenge**: Dangerous | Rating 5 | Escape Outcome

## Bad and Worse Situations

If you are in a Bad situation, and you get a Bad outcome, then you are now in a Worse situation.  
A Worse situation is technically still a Bad situation, it's just worse.  
When rolling to Survive when in a **Worse** situation, then you must **roll 3 times**.  
For each additional Bad situation, then you add +1 to the Worse.  
When rolling to Survive when in a **Worse + X** situation, then you must **roll 3+X times**.

When you roll to Survive,you escape the situation if you succeed even once.  
If a non-Escape outcome helps you when in a Worse situation, you are now in a Bad situation.  
If a non-Escape outcome helps you when in a Bad situation, you are no longer in a Bad situation.  
When a danger is resolved, then all Bad and Worse situations from that danger ends.
