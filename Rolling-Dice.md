# Rolling Dice

In this game, characters complete Challenges by rolling dice.  
Specifically, for each Challenge, roll a 6-sided die.

## Danger

Challenges have a Danger level, a Challenge rating, and an Outcome.  
The Danger level is either:

- Low Stakes: No penalty
- Dangerous: 1 Life penalty
- Deadly: 2 Life penalty

Normally, Challenges are Low Stakes.  
Any time you are under immediate threat, all Challenges are Dangerous.  
When the danger or foe is facing you directly, all Challenges are Deadly.

When you roll a 1 on a dice, then the hero faces the penalty given by the Danger level.  
Depending on the Danger level, the hero loses Life, and possibly dies!

## Rating

The Difficulty rating can be from 2-6.  
If your dice roll meets the rating or goes above it, you succeed.  
If not, you fail.  
If you Fail, then you get a Bad Outcome, and you are put in a Bad situation.  
If you Succeed, then you get the Outcome decided by the challenge.

Ratings are based on Difficulty:

- Easy: Rating 3
- Medium: Rating 4
- Hard: Rating 5

## Rolling to Kill

If you are trying to kill something, then you must roll the very specific **Kill** challenge.  
This is the only challenge that is always Deadly.  
Rolling to Kill is a Tiered Challenge, with 2 successful outcomes.

Rolling a 3-4 will deal 1 damage to the target, but it will place you in a Bad situation.  
Rolling a 5-6 will deal 2 damage to the target, and it will lead to a Favorable outcome.

Dealing damage removes that much Life from the target.

**Kill Challenge**: Deadly  
-- 3-4: 1 damage, Bad outcome  
-- 5-6: 2 damage, Favorable outcome

## Items

You can find and use items to save you from catastrophe.  
When you use an item to help with a Challenge, you can reduce a Danger level from Deadly to Dangerous.  
You cannot reduce it to Low Stakes.

Items are 1 use.  
After using an item, the item cannot be used again.

## Describing Challenges
