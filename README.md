# Snake-Eyed Heroes

Have you ever played a TTRPG and thought: "My characters are just too strong!"  
Well, Snake-Eyed Heroes goes below 1st level, because you play 0th level characters.  
Each player controls 3-4 heroes as they all face a life-or-death scenario.
It is a very loose game that deals with Challenges and Outcomes.
